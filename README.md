# Modular Web Dev Team Site (Data‑driven)

- Edit pricing in `assets/js/data.js`. The UI (sub-nav, cards, checkout, plan compare) updates automatically.
- Pages: index, pricing, about, contact, checkout → payment → success/failed.
- Light/Dark toggle, cookie banner, enriched SEO schema, dynamic JSON-LD Offers.
- Managed services, gallery placeholders, and about-page stats are defined in `assets/js/data.js` for quick swaps.
- Copy `assets/js/env.sample.js` to `assets/js/env.js` (or populate env vars) to point contact/quote forms at your webhook or email service.
